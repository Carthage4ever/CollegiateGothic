# Collegiate Gothic: Bryn Mawr and Beyond

Instructors: Jeffrey Cohen and Alicia Walker

## Course description

Can architecture shape the way we feel, think, and live? Do the buildings in which we work, live, and study affect the way others perceive and judge us? Can an institution’s reputation and identity be forged in part through its physical environment? This course examines these questions through study of the early stages of development of Bryn Mawr’s campus, exploring the ways in which the founders of Bryn Mawr understood architecture as a key aspect of the institution’s image and aspirations. We will consider the buildings of Bryn Mawr in relation to nineteenth-century debates surrounding the acceptability and appropriate nature of women’s higher education; current trends in architectural forms at the new women’s colleges established in England and the United States at this time; and the ways in which M. Carey Thomas (the second president of Bryn Mawr) understood architecture to be a crucial aspect of the reputation and goals of “her” new institution.
